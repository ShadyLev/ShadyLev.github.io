    <h2 class="greenEntry">Who's me?</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I am an aspiring gameplay programmer from Poland currently studying in the UK!
      During my time in high school where I took an extended IT course I learned a lot about developing principles but also about working in a team. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many other people I always enjoyed playing video games as they helped me relax and escape into another universe, that is why I decided to take a 
      game programming course. So I can learn how to create games and give the same feeling I love to other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      After coming to Falmouth University and creating my first ever game in a real team environment I knew exactly I took the right path. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="greenEntry">T-Shaped</h2>
    <p>
      After working in many teams creating games I learned a lot about the values of communication with other specialities and flexibility.
    </p> 
    <p> Many times I had to 
      quickly adapt and fill out a role to help out my team finish a sprint. Begin familiar with different parts of game development helps me see the bigger  
      picture during development as well as confidence to help my team when they are in need.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also very familiar with the agile workflow and version control. In most of my projects I have used Trello to organize user stories and GitHub for version control.
    </p>
    <h2 class="greenEntry">What else?</h2>
    <p>
      During my time creating games I have learned a lot of important lessons. From proffesional practises like the agile workflow all the way to personal lessons about
      communication and empathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of game development I enjoy traveling when possible, nature, board games, martial arts and of course video games! 
    </p>
