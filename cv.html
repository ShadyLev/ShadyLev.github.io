    <h2 class="greenEntry">Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I am a gameplay programmer from Poland, working at Freejam as a junior gameplay programmer in Portsmouth, UK.
      Hi! I am a gameplay programmer from Poland, previously working at Freejam as a gameplay programmer in Portsmouth, UK.
      I graduated a Gameplay Programming course at Falmouth University with First-Class Honours.
      During my time in high school, where I took an extended IT course, I learned a lot about developing principles and working as part of a team. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many other people I always enjoyed playing video games as they helped me relax and escape into another universe, that with the fact that I love programming 
      and solving different challenges is why I decided to take a game programming course. Creating games helps me give the same feeling I love to other people. 
    </p>
    <p>
      After coming to Falmouth University and creating my first ever game in a real team environment, I knew exactly I took the right path. Which I now enjoy even more when
      working in the games industry.
    </p>
    <h2 class="greenEntry">T-Shaped</h2>
    <p>
      After working in many teams of up to 22 people creating games, I learned a lot about the values of communication with other specialities and flexibility.
    </p> 
    <p> Many times I had to 
      quickly adapt and fill out a role to help out my team finish a sprint. Being familiar with different parts of game development helps me see the bigger  
      picture during development as well as confidence to help my team when they are in need.
    </p>
    <h2 class="greenEntry">Skills and hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      The past 5 years of creating games polished many of my skills. From technical ones like being more proficient in programming languages and becoming very familiar with
      Unity and Unreal Engine, all the way to skills that are very useful in the industry. Those include using version control (Git and Perforce), knowing how to work in the agile workflow(scrum) and closely 
      working with other game development disciplines like designers, artists, animators and other programmers. I can deliver polished new gameplay features, profile and optimize projects and
      quickly debug and fix any issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of game development I enjoy traveling when possible, nature, board games, martial arts and of course video games!
